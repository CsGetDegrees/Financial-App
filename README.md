----------------------------------------------------DESCRIPTION-----------------------------------------------
Budgetable is a budgeting app that is designed to be used daily by anyone with an iPhone. The application allows users to track their current and previous expenditure in relation to the budget they set themselves. Users will be able to use this comparison to see where they are overspending if applicable and improve their spending habits. The app will provide charts, goals, income, expenses and notifications

Now you are done! 
The app is currently a working version of the software, but there is much more to add.
Click the "?" On the top left of the main page, to view help on how to use the app.

**If the build has any errors, try changing the type of phone you are simulating on. We believe this is a problem with the Xcode simulator.
